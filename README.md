This tutorial discusses the use of registrations within an NGSI-LD data space. The four different forms of registration
are explained and detailed examples given. Based on a simple data space of interacting context brokers, a complete Farm
Management Information System is created using the _System-of-Systems_ approach, displaying a holistic overview of the
entire farm.

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as
[Postman documentation](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Context-Providers/ngsi-ld.html)

# NGSI-LD Registrations

NGSI-LD Registrations provide the basic mechanism to allow the components within a Smart Linked Data Solution to share
information and interact with each other.

As a brief reminder, within a distributed system, subscriptions inform a third party component that a change in the
context data has occurred (and the component needs to take further actions), whereas registrations inform the context
broker that additional context information is available from another context source.

In constrast to NGSI-v2, NGSI-LD is designed to supports federated, distributed deployments with multiple context
sources, which can also be full context brokers forming a data space, and potentially coming from external systems not
under the control of the implementor themselves. NGSI-LD context sources, may be context brokers, but they may also be
IoT agents or other context sources which only implement part of the NGSI-LD API. For example an IoT Actuator may only
support a single **PATCH** endpoint to alter the status of the device and nothing more.

A context broker uses an internal registry to understand what information is available, which entity types can be found
where and which NGSI-LD API endpoints (or subset of endpoints) are available from each context source. The context
broker then uses this information from the registry to access and aggregate information to be returned - for example
merging two views of an entity to retrieve the full information when making a **GET** request.

The actual source of any context data is hidden from the end-user since NGSI-LD interactions are purely based around
interfaces, this enables the creation of a hierarchy of context brokers - **Broker A** requests data from **Broker B**
which in turn requests data from **Broker C** and so on. Securing the data space using distribute trust mechanisms is
vital since no central control that can be assumed. Furthermore the standard JSON-LD concepts of `@context` and
expansion/compaction operations mean that data can always be retrieved using the preferred terminology of the end-user.

There are four basic types of registration in NGSI-LD - these are described in more detail below:

### Additive Registrations

With additive registrations, a Context Broker is permitted to hold context data about the Entities and Attributes
locally itself, and also obtain data from (possibly multiple) external sources:

-   An **inclusive** Context Source Registration specifies that the Context Broker considers all registered Context
    Sources as equals and will distribute operations to those Context Sources even if relevant context data is available
    directly within the Context Broker itself (in which case, all results will be integrated in the final response).
    This is the default mode of operation.
-   An **auxiliary** Context Source Registration never overrides data held directly within a Context Broker. Auxiliary
    distributed operations are limited to context information consumption operations (see clause 5.7). Context data from
    auxiliary context sources is only included if it is supplementary to the context data otherwise available to the
    Context Broker.

### Proxied Registrations

With proxied registrations, Context Broker is **not permitted** to hold context data about the Entities and Attributes
locally itself. All context data is obtained from the external registered sources.

-   An **exclusive** Context Source Registration specifies that all of the registered context data is held in a single
    location external to the Context Broker. The Context Broker itself holds no data locally about the registered
    Attributes and no overlapping proxied Context Source Registrations shall be supported for the same combination of
    registered Attributes on the Entity. An exclusive registration must be fully specified. It always relates to
    specific Attributes found on a single Entity. It can be used for actuations
-   A **redirect** Context Source Registration also specifies that the registered context data is held in a location
    external to the Context Broker, but potentially multiple distinct redirect registrations can apply at the same time.

> [!NOTE] > **Exclusive** registrations remain as the default operation mode for simpler NGSI-v2-based systems. However,
> since NGSI-v2 uses JSON - not JSON-LD - it is unable to freely function within a federated data space without the
> concept of `@context`. An NGSI-v2 context broker always forms the leaf node in a broker hierarchy. A comparision
> between NGSI-v2 and NGSI-LD registrations can be found
> [here](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/).
>
> It remains possible to attach NGSI-v2 data sources into an NGSI-LD data space using a proxy serving a fixed
> `@context` - this is described in more detail [here](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Linked-Data/tree/NGSI-LD)

## Entities within a Farm Information Management System

-   An animal is livestock found on the farm. Each **Animal** entity would have properties such as:
    -   A name of the Animal e.g. "Twilight the Cow"
    -   A physical location e.g. _52.5075 N, 13.3903 E_
    -   The weight of the Animal
    -   An association to the store in which the shelf is present
    -   Relationships to their parental lineage `calvedBy` / `siredBy`
    -   Relationship to their feedstock e.g. "Oats"

An **Animal** can be `locatedAt` either a **Building** or an **AgriParcel**

-   A building is a real world bricks and mortar farm building. **Building** entities would have properties such as:

    -   A name of the store e.g. "Checkpoint Markt"
    -   An address "Friedrichstra√üe 44, 10969 Kreuzberg, Berlin"
    -   A physical location e.g. _52.5075 N, 13.3903 E_
    -   A relationship to the owner of the building.

-   An AgriParcel is a plot of land on the farm, sometimes called a partfield. **AgriParcel** entities would have
    properties such as:
    -   A name of the store e.g. "Checkpoint Markt"
    -   An address "Friedrichstra√üe 44, 10969 Kreuzberg, Berlin"
    -   A physical location e.g. _52.5075 N, 13.3903 E_
    -   A relationship to the owner of the building.

Additionally devices such as a **TemperatureSensor** can be placed in a **Building** or an **AgriParcel** to measuer the
`temperature`

## Farm Management Information System frontend

The simple Node.js Express application has updated to use NGSI-LD in the previous
[tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Getting-Started/). We will use the application to monitor the data being
received from the data space as a whole. It can accessed from the following URLs:

The FMIS can be found at: `http://localhost:3000/`

![FIWARE Monitor](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Context-Providers/img/fmis.png)

#### Animals

Animals can be under `http://localhost:3000/app/animal/<urn>`

![Store](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Context-Providers/img/cow-101-buttercup.png)

#### Buildings

Animals can be under `http://localhost:3000/app/building/<urn>`

![Store2](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Context-Providers/img/animal-farm.png)

# Prerequisites

## Docker

To keep things simple all components will be run using [Docker](https://www.docker.com). **Docker** is a container
technology which allows to different components isolated into their respective environments.

-   To install Docker on Windows follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
-   To install Docker on Mac follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
-   To install Docker on Linux follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. A
[YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fiware/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/master/docker-compose/orion-ld.yml)
is used configure the required services for the application. This means all container services can be brought up in a
single command. Docker Compose is installed by default as part of Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac, however Linux
users will need to follow the instructions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

# Architecture

The demo Farm Management Information System (FMIS) application will send and receive NGSI-LD calls using a compliant
context broker. To keep the archirecture simple, the demo will make use of only one FIWARE component, with data from a
single context broker being split across a series of subsystems each using a different tenant in emulation of a full
data space.

Currently, the Orion Context Broker relies on open source [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep
persistence of the context data it holds. To request context data from external sources, a simple Context Provider NGSI
proxy has also been added. To visualize and interact with the Context we will add a simple Express application

Therefore the overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   The [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will send and receive requests
    using
    [NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/raw/master/spec/updated/generated/full_api.json).
    This is split into the following systems, each running on their own tenant:
    -   The default tenant which holds **Building** data and is used for collating data from all systems
    -   The `farmer` tenant which holds **Animal**, **Device** and **AgriParcel** information
    -   The `contractor` tenant holds **Animal** data about animals needing additional care.
    -   The `vet` tenant which holds **Animal** data about new-born animals
-   The FIWARE [IoT Agent for UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive
    southbound requests using
    [NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/raw/master/spec/updated/generated/full_api.json)
    and convert them to
    [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
    commands for the devices
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
    -   Used by the **Orion Context Broker** to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations
    -   Used by the **IoT Agent** to hold device information such as device URLs and Keys
-   An HTTP **Web-Server** which offers static `@context` files defining the context entities within the system.
-   The **Tutorial Application** does the following:
    -   Acts as set of dummy [agricultural IoT devices](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.IoT-Sensors/tree/NGSI-LD)
        using the
        [UltraLight 2.0](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usermanual/index.html#user-programmers-manual)
        protocol running over HTTP.
    -   Displays a running Farm Management Information System (FMIS)

Since all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the entities can be containerized and run
from exposed ports.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Context-Providers/img/architecture-ngsi-ld.png)

The necessary configuration information can be seen in the services section of the associated `orion-ld.yml` file. It
has been described in a [previous tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Working-with-Linked-Data/)

# Start Up

All services can be initialised from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Context-Providers/blob/NGSI-LD/services) Bash script provided within the

>
> ```
> ./services stop
> ```

---

# Creating a Redirection Registration

Before adding the registration, goto `http://localhost:3000/` to display and interact with the FMIS data. Initially,
only the Building data from the previous tutorial is available, since this has been loaded onto the default tenant.

### Reading Animal data

The farmer's data about animals on the farm has been preloaded onto the `farmer` tenant and a simple forwarding proxy
set up on port 1027. The farmer's data can be read as shown:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

```console
curl -L 'http://localhost:1027/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/?type=Animal&limit=100&options=concise' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json'
```

#### Response:

The response consists of the details of the subscriptions within the system. The parameters within the `q` attribute
have been expanded to use the full URIs, as internally the broker consistently uses long names. The differences between
the payloads offered by the two subscriptions will be discussed below.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Animal:cow001",
        "type": "Animal",
        "name": "Beany",
        "fedWith": "Grass",
        "legalId": "M-bull001-Beany",
        "phenologicalCondition": {
            "vocab": "maleAdult"
        },
        "reproductiveCondition": {
            "vocab": "active",
            "observedAt": "2024-01-01T15:00:00.000Z"
        },
        "sex": {
            "vocab": "Male"
        },
        "species": "dairy cattle"
    },
   ...etc
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

```console
curl -L 'http://localhost:1027/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/?type=Animal&limit=100&options=concise' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json'
```

#### Response:

The equivalent request on the default tenant FMIS system initially returns no data

```json
[]
```

### Creating a redirection registration

A redirection registration informs a context broker that all data for a given `type` is held in another context source.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

```console
curl -L 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/csourceRegistrations/' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "type": "ContextSourceRegistration",
    "information": [
        {
            "entities": [
                {
                    "type": "Animal"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "mode": "redirect",
    "operations": [
        "redirectionOps"
    ],
    "endpoint": "http://farmer"
}'
```

`"mode":"redirect"` prevents the FMIS context broker from holding any `type=Animal` data whatsoever. All `type=Animal`
requests are forwarded elsewhere. `operations": "redirectionOps"` is a short-hand for all NGSI-LD endpoints - any CRUD
operations will now affect the farmer sub-system (i.e. the farmer tenant), not the FMIS system (i.e. the default
tenant). Effectively this registration has ceded the control of `type=Animal` to the farmer subsystem. After creating
the registration, resending the `type=Animal` request on the FMIS system (the default tenant) now returns all the
animals from the farmer subsystem:

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

```console
curl -L 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/?type=Animal&limit=100&options=concise' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/user-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json'
```

#### Response:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Animal:cow001",
        "type": "Animal",
        "name": "Beany",
        "fedWith": "Grass",
        "legalId": "M-bull001-Beany",
        "phenologicalCondition": {
            "vocab": "maleAdult"
        },
        "reproductiveCondition": {
            "vocab": "active",
            "observedAt": "2024-01-01T15:00:00.000Z"
        },
        "sex": {
            "vocab": "Male"
        },
        "species": "dairy cattle"
    },
   ...etc
```

The animals can now aslo be found within the tutorial application `http://localhost:3000/` .

### Read Subscription Details

Subscription details can be read by making a GET request to the `/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/`. All subscription CRUD
actions continue to be mapped to the same HTTP verbs as before. Adding the `Accept: application/json` will remove the
`@context` element from the response body.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

```console
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/subscriptions/'
```

#### Response:

The response consists of the details of the subscriptions within the system. The parameters within the `q` attribute
have been expanded to use the full URIs, as internally the broker consistently uses long names. The differences between
the payloads offered by the two subscriptions will be discussed below.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Subscription:5e62405ee232da3a07b5fa7f",
        "type": "Subscription",
        "description": "Notify me of low stock in Store 001",
        "entities": [
            {
                "type": "Shelf"
            }
        ],
        "watchedAttributes": ["numberOfItems"],
        "q": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/schema/numberOfItems<10;https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/schema/locatedIn==%22urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001%22",
        "notification": {
            "attributes": ["numberOfItems", "stocks", "locatedIn"],
            "format": "keyValues",
            "endpoint": {
                "uri": "http://tutorial:3000/subscription/low-stock-store001",
                "accept": "application/json"
            }
        },
        "@context": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld"
    },
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Subscription:5e624063e232da3a07b5fa80",
        "type": "Subscription",
        "description": "Notify me of low stock in Store 002",
        "entities": [
            {
                "type": "Shelf"
            }
        ],
        "watchedAttributes": ["numberOfItems"],
        "q": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/schema/numberOfItems<10;https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/schema/locatedIn==%22urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store002%22",
        "notification": {
            "attributes": ["numberOfItems", "stocks", "locatedIn"],
            "format": "keyValues",
            "endpoint": {
                "uri": "http://tutorial:3000/subscription/low-stock-store002",
                "accept": "application/json"
            }
        },
        "@context": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld"
    }
]
```

### Retrieving Subscription Events

Open two tabs on a browser. Go to the event monitor (`http://localhost:3000/app/monitor`) to see the payloads that are
received when a subscription fires, and then go to store001
(`http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001`) and buy beer until less than 10 items are in stock.
The low stock message should be displayed on screen.

![low-stock](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/low-stock-warehouse.png)

`low-stock-store001` is fired when the Products on the shelves within Store001 are getting low, the subscription payload
can be seen below:

![low-stock-json](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/low-stock-monitor.png)

The data within the payload consists of key-value pairs of the attributes which were specified in the request. This is
because the subscription was created using the `format=keyValues` attribute. The `@context` is not present in the
payload body since `endpoint.accept=application/json` was set. The effect is to return a `data` array in a very similar
format to the `v2/subscription/` payload. In addition to the `data` array, the `subscriptionId` is included in the
response, along with a `notifiedAt` element which describes when the notification was fired.

Now go to store002 (`http://localhost:3000/app/store/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store002`) and buy beer until fewer than 10
items are in stock. The low stock message is once again displayed on screen, the payload can be seen within the event
monitor.

![low-stock-ld](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/low-stock-monitor-ld.png)

The second subscription has been set up to pass the full normalized NGSI-LD payload along with the `@context`. This has
been achieved by using the using the `format=normalized` attribute within the subscription itself, as well as setting
`endpoint.accept=application/ld+json`, so that the `@context` is also passed with each entity.

## Using Registrations with NGSI-LD

Context Registrations allow some (or all) data within an entity to be provided by an external context provider. It could
be another full context-provider a separate micro-service which only responds to a subset of the NGSI-LD endpoints.
However, there needs to be a contract created as to who supplies what.

All **NGSI-LD** registrations can be subdivided into one of four types:

### Additive Registrations

A Context Broker is permitted to hold context data about the Entities and Attributes locally itself, and also obtain
data from (possibly multiple) external sources

-   An **inclusive** Context Source Registration specifies that the Context Broker considers all registered Context
    Sources as equals and will distribute operations to those Context Sources even if relevant context data is available
    directly within the Context Broker itself (in which case, all results will be integrated in the final response).
    This federative and is the default mode of operation.

-   An **auxiliary** Context Source Registration never overrides data held directly within a Context Broker. Auxiliary
    distributed operations are limited to context information consumption operations (i.e. entity **GET** operations).
    Context data from auxiliary context sources is only included if it is supplementary to the context data otherwise
    available to the Context Broker.

### Proxied Registrations

A Context Broker is not permitted to hold context data about the Entities and Attributes locally itself. All context
data is obtained from the external registered sources.

-   An **exclusive** Context Source Registration specifies that all of the registered context data is held in a single
    location external to the Context Broker. The Context Broker itself holds no data locally about the registered
    Attributes and no overlapping proxied Context Source Registrations shall be supported for the same combination of
    registered Attributes on the Entity. An exclusive registration must be fully specified. It always relates to
    specific Attributes found on a single Entity. It can be used for actuations

-   A **redirect** Context Source Registration also specifies that the registered context data is held in a location
    external to the Context Broker, but potentially multiple distinct redirect registrations can apply at the same time.

### Accepted Operations

**NGSI-LD** also defines groups of operations that are allowed on the registrant. The default group is called
`federationOps` and includes all entity **GET** operations. Three other common operational groups are also defined
`updateOps` (for actuators), `retrieveOps` (for "lazy" sensors) and `redirectionOps` (for hierarchical broker
architectures). The details won't be covered here, but it should be noted that unless specified, the default **NGSI-LD**
operation is `federationOps` using `inclusive` mode, whereas the default **NGSI-v2** operation is
`updateOps + retrieveOps` using `exclusive` mode.

For simplicity, for **NGSI-v2** - **NGSI-LD** comparison, this tutorial will only deal with `exclusive` mode, which is
the only mode offered by **NGSI-v2** brokers.

With the **NGSI-LD** `exclusive` mode, all registrations can be subdivided into one of two types. Simple registrations
where a single context provider is responsible for the maintenance of the whole entity, and partial registrations where
attributes are spread across multiple context providers. For a simple registration, all context requests are forwarded

| Request    | Action at **Context Broker**                                                | Action at **Context Provider**                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GET**    | Pass request to **Context Provider**, proxy the response back unaltered.    | Respond to context broker with the result of the GET request based on the entities held internally  |
| **PATCH**  | Pass request to **Context Provider**, proxy back the HTTP back status code. | Update the entity within the **Context Provider**, Respond to the context broker with a status code |
| **DELETE** | Pass request to **Context Provider**                                        | Delete the entity within the **Context Provider**, Respond to the context broker with a status code |

Effectively every simple registration is saying _"this entity is held elsewhere"_, but the entity data can be requested
and modified via requests to this context broker. All context brokers should support simple registrations, and indeed,
simple registrations such as these are necessary for the operation of federated arrays of context brokers working in
large scale systems, where there is no concept of "entity exclusiveness", that is no entity is bound to an individual
broker.

For partial registrations the situation is more complex

| Request    | Action at **Context Broker**                                                                                                                                                                                                | Action at **Context Provider**                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GET**    | Assuming an entity exists locally, pass request for additional proxied attributes to **Context Provider**, concatenate a response back for locally held attributes and additional information from the **Context Provider** | Respond to context broker with the result of the GET request based on the entities held internally                                   |
| **PATCH**  | Update any locally held attributes, Pass update requests for additional attributes to **Context Provider**, and return **success** or **partial success** HTTP status code dependent upon the overall result.               | Update the requested attributes of the entity held within the **Context Provider**. Respond to the context broker with a status code |
| **DELETE** | If deleting an entity, remove the complete local instance. If deleting locally held attributes remove them. If deleting attributes held in the **Context Provider**, pass request on to **Context Provider**                | Delete the entity attributes within the **Context Provider**, Respond to the context broker with a status code                       |

Each partial registration is saying _"additional augmented context for this entity is held elsewhere"_. The entity data
can be requested and modified via requests to this context broker. In this case the entity data is effectively bound to
an individual context broker, and therefore may need special processing when running in a large-scale federated
environment. Covering the special needs of the federation use-case is not the concern of this tutorial here.

Note that within the context broker a single entity cannot partake in both a simple registration and a partial
registration at the same time, as this would indicate that both the whole entity and only part of that entity are to be
retrieved remotely and this is nonsensical. If such a situation is requested, the context broker will return with a
`409` - **Conflict** HTTP response.

Also, a simple registration for an entity will be rejected if an entity already exists within the context broker, and a
partial registration for an entity attribute will be rejected if the attribute exists within the context broker (or is
already subject to a partial registration). The latter may be ovecome with the use of the `datasetId`.

Internally the [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) header is
used to avoid circular dependencies where **context broker A** registers an entity with **context broker B** which
registers an entity with **context broker C** which registers an entity with **context broker A** again. The
`X-Forwarded-For` Header is removed prior to responding to a client however.

With normal operation, the NGSI-LD response does not expose whether data collated from multiple sources is held directly
within the context broker or whether the information has been retrieved externally. It is only when an error occurs
(e.g. timeout) that the HTTP status error code reveals that externally held information could not be retrieved or
amended.

### Create a Registration

All NGSI-LD Context Provider Registration actions take place on the `/ngsi-ld/v1/csourceRegistrations/` endpoint. The
standard CRUD mappings apply. The `@context` must be passed either as a `Link` header or within the main body of the
request.

The body of the request is similar to the **NGSI-v2** equivalent with the following modifications:

-   The **NGSI-v2** `dataProvided` object is now an array called `information`.
-   **NGSI-v2** `attrs` have been split into separate arrays of `propertyNames` and `relationshipNames`
-   The **NGSI-v2** `provider.url` has moved up to `endpoint`
-   The **NGSI-LD** `mode` and `operations` are now required - if they are missing the defaults are `federationOps` and
    `inclusive` which does not match the default **NGSI-v2** `supportedForwardingMode`

`contextSourceInfo` usually defines additional HTTP Headers which are passed to the registrant, but `jsonldContext` is a
special key which fires a JSON-LD expansion/compaction operation to ensure that the attribute names within the request
match the expected **NGSI-v2** attribute names.

### Read Registration Details

Retrieving the registration details can be made by sending a GET request to the `/ngsi-ld/v1/csourceRegistrations/`
endpoint, along with an appropriate JSON-LD context in the `Link` header and the `type` of entity to filter

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

```console
curl -G -iX GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/csourceRegistrations/' \
-H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-d 'type=Building'
```

#### Response:

The response returns the details of the registration. In this case the short names of the `properties` have been
returned, along with the `@context`.

```json
[
    {
        "@context": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld",
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:ContextSourceRegistration:5e6242179c26be5aef9991d4",
        "type": "ContextSourceRegistration",
        "endpoint": "http://tutorial:3000/static/tweets",
        "information": [
            {
                "entities": [
                    {
                        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001",
                        "type": "Building"
                    }
                ],
                "properties": ["tweets"]
            }
        ],
        "contextSourceInfo": [
            {
                "key": "jsonldContext",
                "value": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld"
            }
        ],
        "mode": "exclusive",
        "operations": ["updateOps", "retrieveOps"]
    }
]
```

### Read from Store 1

Once a registration has been set up, the additional registered `properties` and `relationships` are transparently
returned when an requested entity is requested. For simple registrations, a request to obtain the whole entity will be
proxied to the registered `endpoint`, for partial registrations the `properties` and `relationships` are added to the
existing entity held within the context broker.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

```console
curl -iX GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

> Note that at the time of writing, for the federated Scorpio broker, this request indicates the retrieval of a local
> entity only - forwarded data from a registration must be retrieved using:
> `/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/?id=urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001` instead.

#### Response:

The response now holds an additional `tweets` Property, which returns the values obtained from
`http://tutorial:3000/static/tweets/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001` - i.e. the forwarding endpoint.

```json
{
    "@context": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld",
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001",
    "type": "Building",

            "addressLocality": "Prenzlauer Berg",
            "postalCode": "10439"
        },
        "verified": {

        "value": "commercial"
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "GeoProperty",
        "value": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [13.3986, 52.5547]
        }
    },
    "tweets": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": [
            "It has great practical value ‚Äì you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta;",
            "You can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours;",
            "You can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon;",
            "Use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth;",
            "Wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat;",
            "Wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal  (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can‚Äôt see it, it can‚Äôt see you ‚Äì daft as a bush, but very, very ravenous);",
            "You can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough."
        ]
    }
}
```

The same response data can be seen within the supermarket application itself. In practice this data has been created via
a series of requests - the context broker is responsible for the `urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001` data, however it checks
to see if any further information can be provided from other sources. In our case the `CSourceRegistration` indicates
that one further attribute _may_ be available. The broker then requests `tweets` information from the context provider,
and provided that it responds in a timely manner, the `tweets` information is added to the resultant payload.

The supermarket application displays the received data on screen within the supermarket application itself:

![tweets-1](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/tweets-1.png)

### Read direct from the Context Provider

Every context-provider must stand by a fixed contract. At a minimum must be able to respond to varieties of the
`/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/<entity-id>` GET request. If the registration is limited to certain properties, this request will
also contain an `attrs` parameter in the query string.

Dependent upon the use case of the context-provider, it may or may not need to be able to interpret JSON-LD `@context` -
in this case a request is merely returning the full `tweets` attribute.

The same request is made by the context broker itself when querying for registered attributes

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

```console
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/static/tweets/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001?attrs=tweets' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json'
```

#### Response:

As can be seen the `@context` has been returned in the request (since the `Content-Type` header was set). The rest of
the response resembles any standard NGSI-LD request.

```json
{
    "@context": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld",
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001",
    "type": "Building",
    "tweets": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": [
            "It has great practical value ‚Äì you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta;",
            "You can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours;",
            "You can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon;",
            "Use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth;",
            "Wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat;",
            "Wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can‚Äôt see it, it can‚Äôt see you ‚Äì daft as a bush, but very, very ravenous);",
            "You can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough."
        ]
    }
}
```

### Direct update of the Context Provider

For a read-write interface it is also possible to amend context data by making a PATCH request to the relevant
`ngsi-ld/v1/entities/<entity-id>/attrs` endpoint.

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

```console
curl -L -X PATCH 'http://localhost:3000/static/tweets/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001/attrs' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "tweets": {
    "type": "Property",
    "value": [
      "Space is big.",
      "You just won'\''t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.",
      "I mean, you may think it'\''s a long way down the road to the chemist'\''s, but that'\''s just peanuts to space."
    ]
  }
}'
```

#### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

If the regisitered attribute is requested from the context broker, it returns the _updated_ values obtained from
`http://tutorial:3000/static/tweets/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001` - i.e. the forwarding endpoint.

```console
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001?attrs=tweets&options=keyValues' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"'
```

#### Response:

This alters the response to match the values updated in the previous PATCH request.

```json
{
    "@context": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld",
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001",
    "type": "Building",
    "tweets": [
        "Space is big.",
        "You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.",
        "I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space."
    ]
}
```

Since the context provider is responsible for supplying `tweets` information, changes in the context provider will
always be reflected in requests to the context-broker itself. The supermarket application is calling the context broker
for context regardless of origin, so the updated `tweets` data are displayed on screen within the supermarket
application itself:

![tweets-2](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/tweets-2.png)

The context broker is therefore able to return a complete holistic picture of the current state of the world.

### Forwarded Update

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

A PATCH request to the context broker ( either `ngsi-ld/v1/entities/<entity-id>/` or
`ngsi-ld/v1/entities/<entity-id>/attrs`) will be forwarded to the registered context provider if a registration is
found. It is therefore possible to alter the state of a context-provider as a side effect. Of course, not all context
providers are necessarily read-write, so attempting to change the attributes of forwarded context may not be fully
respected.

In this case however a request to PATCH `ngsi-ld/v1/entities/<entity-id>` will be successfully forwarded as a series of
`ngsi-ld/v1/entities/<entity-id>/attrs` requests for each regsitered attribute that is found in the registration.

```console
curl -L -X PATCH 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001/attrs/tweets' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "type": "Property",
  "value": [
    "This must be Thursday",
    "I never could get the hang of Thursdays."
  ]
} '
```

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Request:

The result of the previous operation can be seen by retrieving the whole entity using a GET request.

```console
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001?attrs=tweets&options=keyValues' \
-H 'Link: <https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

#### Response:

This alters the response to match the values updated in the previous PATCH request which was sent to the context broker
and then forwarded to the context provider endpoint.

```json
{
    "@context": "https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Step-by-Step/tutorials-context.jsonld",
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:store001",
    "type": "Building",
    "tweets": ["This must be Thursday", "I never could get the hang of Thursdays."]
}
```

As can be seen, the updated `tweets` data is also displayed within the supermarket application itself:

![tweets-3](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.LD-Subscriptions-Registrations/img/tweets-3.png)
